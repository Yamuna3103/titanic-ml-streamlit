# Titanic ML Streamlit App 🚢💻

A Streamlit web application that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using a machine learning model.

This project demonstrates a complete **ML workflow** — from data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to deployment as a user-friendly web app.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this app is to build and deploy a **Titanic Survival Prediction** model using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

Users can enter passenger details like age, gender, class, etc., and the app predicts whether that passenger would survive the Titanic disaster.
